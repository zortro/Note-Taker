## Usage

To use Note Taker, a user must follow the [install](#getting-started) process. Upon loading the web application, the user will be taken to the homepage. Once the 'Get Started' button has been clicked the user will be taken to the notes page, where they can input a title and body for their note. When a title and body have been given to the note a save button will populate in the upper right corner of the screen. Clicking this save button will save the user's note to `./db/db.json`. All user notes will persist until deleted within the file manually. This is a planned feature to be added.
